### [Lung Carcinoma Tumor Detection Using a Feed Forward Neural Network]() 
This project uses Matlab and GUIDE to create an automated tumor detection software, it starts by converting the image to binary, it then takes these vectors and puts it into a feedfoward neural network, using various transfer functions. Once it has been through the neural network, a ouput in between 1 and 3 is compared and used to see if the tumor is cancerous.

### [Facial Recognition Attendance Systsem Using OpenCV]()
This project uses Python with the open source library OpenCV, XlsxWriter, and Sqlite3 to make an attendance system. It starts by collecting user data, name, gender, and date of birth. Next, it takes 60 high quality images of the persons face, saving it to an encrypted folder on the script can access. Then, OpenCV uses the Local Patterns Binary Histograms algorithm to detect and recognize the faces. After the face is recognized, the user data and time checked in is enter into an Excel sheet.
